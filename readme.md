# Description 

This is an example of a college exam. The goal is to make a web app that lets users vote for their favourite player.

The admin has the options to add, delete and edit info about players.

I transformed this app into a independent project of a college student. What i actually did is i rebuild the front-end to be user-friendly and adapted the back-end of the web app so it can connect to MySQL database, where i created a database.

The technologies used in this web app are: Bootstrap, SQL(MySQL) and Spring.
