# Description 

Description:
Originally solved by a [fellow student](https://github.com/Fazlibeqir/Web-Programming/tree/main/Vezbi/NewVersion/kol2023-g1%20Player), as an exam solution, I transformed this project into an independent, full-stack web application. The app allows users to vote for their favorite players, while administrators have the ability to add, delete, and edit player information.

My Contributions:

Front-End: Completely redesigned the user interface using Bootstrap to enhance usability and create a modern, responsive design.

Back-End: Adapted the application to integrate with a MySQL database, ensuring reliable data management and optimized performance.

Technologies Used: Bootstrap, SQL (MySQL), Spring.

This project highlights my ability to take an existing solution, improve it, and expand it into a fully functional web application. It also demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, from UI design to back-end integration.
