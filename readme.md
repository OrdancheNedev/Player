# Description 

Initially solved by [Person's Name or Role, e.g., a fellow student, instructor, etc.], this project was transformed into an independent, full-stack web application through my enhancements. The app allows users to vote for their favorite players, while administrators can add, delete, and edit player information.

My Contributions:

Front-End: Completely rebuilt the user interface using Bootstrap to improve usability and create a responsive, modern design.

Back-End: Adapted the application to integrate with a MySQL database for reliable data management and optimized performance.

Technologies Used: Bootstrap, SQL (MySQL), and Spring.

This project demonstrates my ability to collaborate, improve existing solutions, and implement full-stack development techniques effectively.
